## About percipioglobal/craft

This is an alternate scaffolding package for Craft 3 CMS projects to Pixel & Tonic's canonical [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package.

### Vite buildchain

This project uses a [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for the build system as per [Vite.js Next Generation Frontend Tooling + Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms), as opposed to the usual webpack buildchain.

Some things are still unfinished:

* Favicon generation isn't done; this probably would be done with the [rollup-favicons-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-favicons)
* AMP CSS isn't included; this will likely be done the same way the Critical CSS is done

But if these things aren't important to you, by all means, dive in.

Vite is _fast_ âš¡
 
The project is based on [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) using a unique `templates/_boilerplate` system for web/AJAX/AMP pages, and implements a number of technologies/techniques:
 
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Docker is used for local development; see **Setting Up Local Dev** below for details
* A base Twig templating setup as described in [An Effective Twig Base Templating Setup](https://nystudio107.com/blog/an-effective-twig-base-templating-setup)
* [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) is used for the build system as per [Vite.js Next Generation Frontend Tooling + Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-vite-js-next-generation-frontend-tooling-with-craft-cms)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for strictly typed JavaScript code
* [Vue.js 3.0](https://vuejs.org/) is used for some of the interactive bits on the website, and Vue.js 3.x allows us to leverage the [Composition API](https://composition-api.vuejs.org/) 
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the site-wide CSS
* JSON-LD structured data as per [Annotated JSON-LD Structured Data Examples](https://nystudio107.com/blog/annotated-json-ld-structured-data-examples)
* [Google AMP](https://developers.google.com/amp/) versions of the podcast episode and other pages
* Image transforms are done via a [Serverless Image Handler](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/serverless-image-handler/) lambda function, as described in the [Setting Up Your Own Image Transform Service](https://nystudio107.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-image-transform-service) article
* Static assets are stored in AWS S3 buckets with CloudFront as the CDN, as per the [Setting Up AWS S3 Buckets + CloudFront CDN for your Assets](https://nystudio107.com/blog/using-aws-s3-buckets-cloudfront-distribution-with-craft-cms) article
* Implements a Service Worker via Google's [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) as per [Service Workers and Offline Browsing](https://nystudio107.com/blog/service-workers-and-offline-browsing)
* Critical CSS as per [Implementing Critical CSS on your website](https://nystudio107.com/blog/implementing-critical-css)
* Frontend error handling as per [Handling Errors Gracefully in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/handling-errors-gracefully-in-craft-cms)
* A custom site module as per [Enhancing a Craft CMS 3 Website with a Custom Module](https://nystudio107.com/blog/enhancing-a-craft-cms-3-website-with-a-custom-module)
* CLI-based queue as per [Robust queue job handling in Craft CMS](https://nystudio107.com/blog/robust-queue-job-handling-in-craft-cms)
* [buddy.works](http://buddy.works/) atomic deployments

...and probably a bunch of other stuff too.

## Using percipioglobal/craft

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    `composer create-project percipioglobal/craft:dev-craft-vite PATH --no-install`

Make sure that `PATH` is the path to your project, including the name you want for the project, e.g.:

    `composer create-project percipioglobal/craft:dev-craft-vite vitecraft --no-install --remove-vcs`

We use `--no-install` so that the composer packages for the root project are not installed.

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need Docker desktop for your platform installed to run the project in local development

* Start up the site by typing `make dev` in terminal in the project's root directory (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site; the `vite-dev-server` runs off of `http://localhost:3000`

Wait until you see the following to indicate that the PHP container is ready:

```
php_1         | Craft is installed.
php_1         | Applying changes from your project config files ... done
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: fpm is running, pid 22
php_1         | [01-Dec-2020 18:38:46] NOTICE: ready to handle connections

...and the following to indicate that the Vite container is ready:
```
vite_1        |   vite v2.3.2 dev server running at:
vite_1        |
vite_1        |   > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
vite_1        |   > Network:  http://172.22.0.5:3000/
vite_1        |
vite_1        |   ready in 1573ms.
```

The CP login credentials are initially set as follows:

Login: `support@percipio.london` \
Password: `letmein`

Obviously change these to whatever you like as needed.

Build the production assets by typing make build to build the critical CSS, fonts, and other production assets. They will appear in `cms/web/dist/` (just double-click on the `report-legacy.html` and `report-modern.html` files to view them).

**Important:** To find the correct credentials for `LOCAL_DB_CONTAINER` run `docker-compose up` and once the docker container is running, use the command `docker container ls` to find the correct name of the container.
If your project is called `test` the container will be somewhere along the lines of `test_mariadb` or `test_mysql`. That's the value you do have to enter.

**N.B.:** Without authorization & credentials (which are private), the `./docker_pull_db.sh` will not work. It's provided here for instructional purposes

## Makefile Project Commands

This project uses Docker to shrink-wrap the devops it needs to run around the project.

To make using it easier, we're using a Makefile and the built-in `make` utility to create local aliases. You can run the following from terminal in the project directory:

- `make dev` - starts up the local dev server listening on `http://localhost:8000/`
- `make build` - builds the static assets via the webpack 5 buildchain
- `make clean` - shuts down the Docker containers, removes any mounted volumes (including the database), and then rebuilds the containers from scratch
- `make composer xxx` - runs the `composer` command passed in, e.g. `make composer install`
- `make npm xxx` - runs the `npm` command passed in, e.g. `make npm install`
- `make pulldb` - runs the `scripts/docker_pull_db.sh` script to pull a remote database into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first
- `make restoredb xxx` - runs the `scripts/docker_restore_db.sh` script to restore a local database dump into the database container; the `scripts/.env.sh` must be set up first

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9001,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running Craft CLI commands

Since we are using docker to run our project, we need to execute the craft CLI commands prepended with the docker command `docker-compose exec php`, eg: `docker-compose exec php ./craft project-config/sync`.

## Updating Composer Packages

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do: 

`docker-compose exec php composer update`

or 

```
rm cms/composer.lock
make dev
```


## Updating NPM Packages

To update to the latest npm packages (as constrained by the `buildchain/package.json` semvers), do:

`docker-compose exec webpack npm update`

or 

```
rm buildchain/package-lock.json
make dev
```
